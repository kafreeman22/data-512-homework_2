## Research Implications
### What I have learned
### What I found
### What suprised me about my findings
### Theories about found biases

### Q/A
What biases did you expect to find in the data (before you started working with it), and why?
What (potential) sources of bias did you discover in the course of your data processing and analysis?
What might your results suggest about (English) Wikipedia as a data source?
What might your results suggest about the internet and global society in general?
Can you think of a realistic data science research situation where using these data (to train a model, perform a hypothesis-driven research, or make business decisions) might create biased or misleading results, due to the inherent gaps and limitations of the data?
Can you think of a realistic data science research situation where using these data (to train a model, perform a hypothesis-driven research, or make business decisions) might still be appropriate and useful, despite its inherent limitations and biases?
How might a researcher supplement or transform this dataset to potentially correct for the limitations/biases you observed?
